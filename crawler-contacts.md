# Crawler Contacts

We run production instances of the crawler in three different clouds:

* Azure
* Google Cloud
* AWS

## Azure

The instances running in Azure live in the "OSPO Non-production" Azure subscription, not the ClearlyDefined Azure subscription. Reach out to the Microsoft Open Source Programs Office and/or Open Source Engineering for more information.

## Google Cloud

The Google Cloud contact is Matt Gaunt mattgaunt@google.com

NOTE: The Google Cloud crawlers are currently turned off. Nell Shamrell-Harrington will be following up with them at the beginning of next year (2022).

## AWS

The AWS contact is James Siri jamesiri@amazon.com

NOTE: The AWS crawlers are currently turned off, they need to be able to build the Docker image themselves. Nell will be following up with them on this in Q4 2021.
