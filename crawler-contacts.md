# Crawler Contacts

We run production instances of the crawler in three different clouds:

* Azure
* Google Cloud
* AWS

## Azure

The instances running in Azure live in the "OSPO Non-production" Azure subscription, not the ClearlyDefined Azure subscription. Reach out to the Microsoft Open Source Programs Office and/or Open Source Engineering for more information.
